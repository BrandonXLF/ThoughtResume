# Thought Resume

Thought Resume allows you to record your thoughts to quickly resume what you were doing after meetings, sleeping, outings, or anything else!

## Persistence Notification

Whenever you have thoughts recorded, a persistent notification is displayed so you'll remember to read your thoughts the next time you're on your phone.

Note: As of Android 14, the notification can be momentarily swiped away and cleared. This can be prevented by running the [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) command `adb shell appops set --uid me.brandonfowler.thoughtresume SYSTEM_EXEMPT_FROM_DISMISSIBLE_NOTIFICATIONS allow`.

## Availability

Thought Resume is available for Android.
